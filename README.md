This is a Python-based application that uses computer vision to perform real-time face recognition from a webcam feed. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with **Tkinter** for easy interaction. The system allows for the registration of new users, classifying them as either "Criminal" or "Hostage," and can then identify these registered individuals in a live video stream.
